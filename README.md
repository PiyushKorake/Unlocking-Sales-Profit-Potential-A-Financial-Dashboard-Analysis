# Unlocking Sales & Profit Potential: A Financial Dashboard Analysis

## Overview
This project explores how sales and profit data can be better understood using a financial dashboard. Using Tableau, we created interactive charts to show how different products and customer segments contribute to the company's performance. The goal is to help in making better decisions based on actual data.

## Objectives
- Track total sales month by month
- Identify top-performing products and their share of sales
- Analyze profit contributions by customer segments
- Compare product-wise profit distribution
- Understand which customer segments bring the most sales
- Use data to improve discounting and product strategy

## Tools Used
- Tableau for dashboard creation and visualization
- Excel or a similar spreadsheet to clean and organize the data

## Dashboard Insights
- **Sales Over Time**: Sales peaked in November and were lowest in March
- **Pareto Chart**: Top 3 products (Paseo, VTT, Velo) bring in ~75% of total sales
- **Profit by Segment**: The Government and Small Business segments are most profitable
- **Products by Profit**: Paseo is the highest profit contributor
- **Sales by Segment**: Again, Government and Small Business lead in total sales
- **Dashboard Summary**:
  - Total Sales: $118.73M
  - Total Profit: $16.89M
  - Profit Margin: 14.23%

## Conclusion
The analysis shows that focusing on key products and strong customer segments (like Paseo and Government) can help maximize profit. The dashboard helps spot seasonal trends and areas where strategies (like discounts) need to be adjusted.

## Future Scope
- Add more time range for long-term trends
- Combine with marketing or regional data
- Create alerts for sudden drops in profit or sales
